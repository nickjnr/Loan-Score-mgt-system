# Loan-Management-System
A comprehensive web-based platform to manage different loans &amp; lenders 

## Introduction
The Old Credit System Management made it challenging to get a hold of debts and follow lender progress because its processing was entirely manual. Loans often are recorded on a paper/ledger for managers to keep track of each client’s loan. As managers often record their transactions on paper, computing the revenue will be time-consuming.

With this Financial Technology, you can replace traditional methods which are time-consuming and often require verification of applicants’ credibility and financial information.
